## CORE STRUCTURE

```
[Hook - 2-3 lines before "see more"]

[Expand - Add specific details about opening]

[Evidence - 2-3 concrete examples with data]

[Insight - State what it means]

[End - Action, question, or implication]
```

---

## PART 1: ABOVE THE FOLD (First 2-3 Lines)

**Function:** Hook reader before "see more" truncation (~210 chars desktop, ~140 mobile)

### Pattern Options:

**Result/Metric Opening:**
```
[Number] in [timeframe]. Here's what [happened].
```
Example: "180 candidates in 48 hours. Here's what worked."

**Observation Pattern:**
```
[Quantity] [situation] this [timeframe]. All [commonality].
```
Example: "Three client calls this week. All asked the same question."

**Contradiction Pattern:**
```
Everyone says [X]. We [opposite].
```
Example: "Everyone's hiring for culture fit. Nobody can define it."

**Mid-Story Entry:**
```
[Specific event]. [Surprising result].
```
Example: "The candidate hung up yesterday. Turns out, I deserved it."

### What Kills Hooks:
- Generic greetings
- Vague statements
- Industry clichés
- Emotional performance opening
- Emoji walls before text

---

## PART 2: BODY (After "See More")

### Paragraph Structure:

**Mix Required:**
- Some single-line paragraphs (emphasis)
- Some 2-3 sentence paragraphs (idea development)
- Never all one-line (signals "broetry" cliché)
- Never all long (creates text walls)

### Sentence Length:

**Variation Required:**
- Short (3-5 words) for impact
- Medium (8-15 words) for flow
- Long (20+ words) for detail
- Fragments acceptable for emphasis

### Content Pattern:

```
[Hook]

[Expand opening with specifics]

[Give 2-3 concrete examples with numbers/data]

[State insight clearly]

[End with action/question/implication]
```

---

## PART 3: ENDING

### Effective Patterns:

**Insight Statement:**
```
[State the learning plainly]
```
Example: "Sometimes simple beats clever."

**Genuine Question:**
```
[Authentic curiosity about others' experience]
```
Example: "Anyone else seeing this pattern?"

**Help Offer:**
```
[Natural extension of value provided]
```
Example: "Happy to share the exact search."

**Implication:**
```
[What this means more broadly]
```
Example: "Maybe we're overthinking it."

### What Kills Endings:
- "What do you think? =G"
- "Tag someone who needs this!"
- "Let that sink in"
- Summary of content just shared
- Generic engagement begging

---

## CONTENT TYPE STRUCTURES

### 1. Insight From Work

```
We tested [number] [things] [timeframe].

[Key finding 1]
[Key finding 2]
[Key finding 3]

Worst: [specific example]
Best: [specific example]

[One-line insight]
```

### 2. Pattern Recognition

```
[Number] [situations] this [timeframe]. All [commonality].

"[Common question/issue]"

[Analysis of pattern - what you found]

[List of actual drivers/factors]

[One-line insight]
```

### 3. Contradiction

```
Everyone's [common belief].

[Problem with this belief]

[Evidence - specific examples from your work]:
- [Example 1]
- [Example 2]
- [Example 3]

[Last example that makes point strongest]

[Alternative suggested]
```

### 4. Case Study

```
[Client/situation] [problem] for [timeframe].

Changed [number] things:
1. [Specific change 1]
2. [Specific change 2]
3. [Specific change 3]

[Results] went from [before number] to [after number] in [timeframe].

[One-line lesson]
```

### 5. Simple Observation

```
Noticed something in [data source/situation].

When we [ask/analyze], [percentage]% [finding]:
- [Data point 1]
- [Data point 2]
- [Data point 3]

Almost nobody mentions:
- [Contrast 1]
- [Contrast 2]

[Implication]
```

## FORMATTING RULES

### Paragraph Length:
- Single-line for emphasis points
- 2-3 sentences for building ideas
- Mix creates visual rhythm
- Helps scanning behavior

### White Space:
- One blank line between paragraphs
- Creates visual breathing room
- Signals structure to reader

### Lists:
**Use bullets when:**
- 3+ discrete items
- Comparison needed
- Sequential steps

**Use inline when:**
- 2-3 simple items
- Casual flow preferred

### Emphasis (Platform Constraints):
- LinkedIn doesn't support bold/italics in posts
- Use structure: single-line paragraphs after long ones
- Use sentence length: short after long
- Use fragments: "Every time." "Sorted."

---

## SOFT SELLING STRUCTURE

### Pattern:
```
[Problem described specifically]

[What you tested/changed - with specifics]

[Result with numbers]

[Key insight]

[Natural help offer: "If anyone's struggling with this, happy to [specific help]."]
```

### 80/20 Split:
- 80% pure value (insights, lessons, data)
- 20% gentle promotion (success stories, help offers)

---

## ENGAGEMENT MECHANICS

### Effective Questions:
- Genuine curiosity about others' experience
- Related to insight shared
- Open-ended for varied responses
- Examples: "Anyone else seeing this?" / "What's your experience?" / "Curious if this is just us."

### Ineffective Questions:
- "What do you think? =G" (forced)
- "Agree or disagree?" (binary)
- "Tag someone!" (engagement bait)
- "Comment [word] for [thing]" (algorithm penalty)

---

## HASHTAG STRUCTURE

### Count:
- 1-3 hashtags maximum
- At end of post

### Selection:
- Specific over generic
- Relevant to actual content
- Moderate popularity (10K-500K followers)
- Examples: #RecruitmentTips, #HiringStrategy, #TalentAcquisition

### Avoid:
- 10+ hashtags (spam signal)
- Generic terms (#Success, #Business, #Innovation)
- Not content-specific
- In first comment (outdated tactic)

---

## ANTI-PATTERNS (Platform Clichés)

### Format Signals to Avoid:

**"Broetry" (one word per line):**
```
Sometimes.
The best.
Lessons.
```

**Emoji spam:**
```
=€ HUGE NEWS! <¯
=¡ Here's what I learned =ª
```

**Fake section breaks:**
```
PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
INSIGHT #1:
PPPPPPPPPPPPPPP
```

### Content Signals to Avoid:
- Humble-bragging ("So humbled to announce...")
- Performed vulnerability ("I'm going to be vulnerable...")
- Engagement manipulation ("Comment [word] for PDF")
- Generic wisdom ("Success is a journey...")

### Tone Signals to Avoid:
- Corporate consultant speak ("leverage synergies")
- Motivational speaker energy ("BE the change")
- Tech guru buzzwords ("disrupting the space")

## TIMING (Evidence-Based)

## VALIDATION TEST

**Ask: "Would I send this as an email to a smart colleague?"**

**If YES:** Has substance, good for LinkedIn
**If NO:** Too optimized for algorithm, will sound fake
