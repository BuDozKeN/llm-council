Technical execution and development guidance for AxCouncil.

## Roles

- **CTO** - Chief Technology Officer: Technical strategy and architecture decisions
- **Developer** - Development guidance and code implementation

## CTO Council Setup

Models - 5 models via OpenRouter (Claude, GPT, Gemini, Grok, DeepSeek) - We have the option to include more via OpenRouter if needed.

Framework Prompt - "Bootstrap Technical Guide" - assumes basic Python/GitHub skills, no DevOps experience; provides step-by-step instructions with exact commands and code to copy-paste

Query Format - Include skill level, what you know, request exact steps, commands, and error handling

Escalation Path - If the task takes more than 4-6 hours, CTO Council writes an Upwork freelancer brief instead (this is to be discussed first).
