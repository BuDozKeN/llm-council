## 1. Company Overview

### 1.1 Mission Statement
Productise the AI Council deliberation system to give users peer-reviewed, synthesised answers for high-stakes decisions.

### 1.2 Company Stage
- **Status:** Pre-launch, local development
- **Founded:** 2025

### 1.3 Goals
| Timeframe | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| 12 months | $10,000 USD/month (lifestyle business) |
| Exit | Would sell immediately for $5M (or $2M) |

### 1.4 Legal Structure
12. Decision Log

December 2025 - Hired Head of AI People and Culture
• Rationale: This is the meta-role that creates all future AI staff, ensures consistency across roles, and enforces the Execution Guidance Standard
• Status: Pending execution

December 2025 - Hired AI CTO
• Rationale: Deployment is the single blocker to revenue and the founder has a DevOps gap that was identified in council discussions
• Status: Pending execution

December 2025 - No Human Hires Policy
• Rationale: Human hires violate our constraints of minimal budget, time as primary investment, and low risk tolerance
• Status: Active policy

## 2. The Product

### 2.1 Core Value Proposition
A decision-making platform where users submit important questions and receive answers vetted by multiple AI models through a rigorous 3-stage peer-reviewed process.

### 2.2 The 3-Stage Deliberation Process

| Stage | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Independent Responses | Question goes to 5+ leading AI models simultaneously (Grok, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek), each answering independently |
| 2 | Anonymised Peer Review | Responses are anonymised; each model evaluates and ranks all responses without knowing authorship |
| 3 | Chairman Synthesis | A Chairman model synthesises the best insights into one authoritative answer |

### 2.3 The Vision
Build virtual companies with AI departments and roles. Users assemble their own AI org chart — CMO, CTO, CFO, Head of HR, etc. — each powered by the Council deliberation system.

### 2.4 Use Cases
- Individual advisory for high-stakes decisions
- Department councils (marketing, sales, content, HR, legal, accounting)
- Framework-specific guidance (e.g., tax department following Beckham Law framework for Spain)

### 2.5 Current Features
- Local landing page (not yet deployed)
- Working user flow: Create conversation → Select company → Select department → Apply framework → Triage to clarify question → Submit to Council → Receive synthesised response

### 2.6 Planned Features
*To be added*

### 2.7 Minimum Viable Workflow
1. Log in
2. Create or select their company
3. Build their AI staff (CMO, CTO, CFO, etc.)
4. Submit a question to the relevant department
5. Receive a Council response

- Bilingual: Spanish and English

### 3.2 Skills & Strengths
| Domain | Proficiency |
|--------|-------------|
| Marketing | Strong |
| SEO | Strong |
| Sales | Strong |
| Email Marketing | Strong |
| Claude Code | Learning/Capable |

### 3.4 Constraints
3.4 Constraints

Time - AxCouncil runs existing businesses and development happens opportunistically

Budget - Minimal additional spend using existing tech stack from current company

Risk Tolerance - Low financial risk with primary investment being time

Gaps - DevOps and deployment experience identified as skill gap. This is mitigated by using the CTO Council for step-by-step guidance

No Human Hires - Human employees or contractors ruled out at current stage. AI departments handle all execution guidance instead

**Gaps** - DevOps/deployment experience identified as skill gap; mitigated by using CTO Council for step-by-step guidance

**No Human Hires** - Human employees or contractors ruled out at current stage; AI departments handle all execution guidance

### 3.5 Hard Boundaries
- **No outreach calls** — will not do phone-based sales
- Common sense red lines on problematic industries/topics

---

## 4. Market & Users

### 4.1 Target Market
*To be refined*

### 4.2 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
**Status:** To be determined

**Current hypotheses:**
- People who use AI constantly
- Users tired of iterating with a single LLM
- People who want confidence that AI responses are solid
- Entrepreneurs building bootstrap businesses
- People who cannot afford a full team but need guidance

### 4.3 The Problem We Solve
Users currently:
- Iterate endlessly with one LLM
- Switch between LLMs to verify answers
- Lack confidence in AI responses for high-stakes decisions

### 4.4 Why a Council Beats a Single AI
1. Five top LLM "brains" working on the same problem
2. Anonymised peer review catches blind spots
3. Chairman synthesis delivers one authoritative answer
4. Personas focus the Council (e.g., marketing department)
5. Frameworks provide structured thinking

### 4.5 User Feedback
> "People are blown away — they see it as a solution that works."

### 4.6 User Research Notes
*To be added*

### 7.5 Current Architecture (As Built - December 2025)

**Backend Structure (`backend/`)**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `main.py` | FastAPI app, CORS config, runs on port 8001 |
| `config.py` | `COUNCIL_MODELS` list, `CHAIRMAN_MODEL`, env vars |
| `openrouter.py` | `query_model()`, `query_models_parallel()` |
| `council.py` | 3-stage logic: collect, rank, synthesize |
| `database.py` | Supabase client connection |
| `storage.py` | Supabase-based conversation storage (migrated from JSON) |
| `context_loader.py` | Loads context from `councils/organisations/` |

**Frontend Structure (`frontend/src/`)**

| File | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `App.jsx` | Main orchestration, conversation management |
| `api.js` | API calls to backend, SSE streaming |
| `components/ChatInterface.jsx` | Message input with role selection |
| `components/Stage1.jsx` | Individual model responses (tabs) |
| `components/Stage2.jsx` | Peer review with de-anonymization |
| `components/Stage3.jsx` | Chairman synthesis |
| `components/Sidebar.jsx` | Conversation list |

**Port Configuration**
- Backend: 8001 (NOT 8000 - conflict avoided)
- Frontend: 5173 (Vite default)

**Running Locally**
```bash
# Backend (from project root)
python -m backend.main

# Frontend (from frontend/)
npm run dev
```

### 7.6 Database Schema (Supabase)

| Table | Purpose |
|-------|---------|
| `companies` | Multi-tenant organizations |
| `departments` | Groups roles by department |
| `roles` | AI personas with system_prompt |
| `company_contexts` | Business context markdown |
| `conversations` | Chat sessions |
| `messages` | User/assistant messages with stage1/stage2/stage3 JSONB |

### 7.7 The 3-Stage Deliberation Flow

```
User Query
    ↓
Stage 1: Parallel queries to COUNCIL_MODELS → [individual responses]
    ↓
Stage 2: Anonymize as "Response A/B/C" → Peer ranking → [evaluations]
    ↓
Aggregate Rankings: Calculate average position
    ↓
Stage 3: CHAIRMAN_MODEL synthesizes final answer
    ↓
Return: {stage1, stage2, stage3, metadata}
```

### 7.8 Key Technical Decisions

| Decision | Rationale |
|----------|-----------|
| OpenRouter over direct APIs | Single API for all models, simpler billing |
| Supabase database (LIVE) | Multi-tenant support, cloud persistence, user auth ready |
| SSE streaming | Real-time token display for better UX |
| Anonymized peer review | Prevents model bias in rankings |

### 7.9 Dependencies

**Python (`pyproject.toml`)**
- fastapi, uvicorn, python-dotenv, httpx, pydantic, supabase, gunicorn

**Frontend (`package.json`)**
- react, react-dom, react-markdown, remark-gfm, vite

## 9. Financials & Metrics

### 9.1 Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | Timeframe |
|--------|--------|-----------|
| Paying users | 10 | 90 days |
| MRR | €1,000 | 90 days |
| MRR | €10,000 | 12 months |

### 9.2 Current Revenue
$0 (pre-launch)

### 9.3 Budget Philosophy

**Core Principle:** We invest time, not money. But if spending money delivers clear ROI or saves significant time, it's worth considering.

**Decision Framework:**
- Prefer free/cheap tiers for infrastructure (<€20/month total hosting)
- Freelancers only if task would block progress for 6+ hours AND cannot be simplified
- Any spend >€50 requires explicit ROI justification
- **Always propose paid solutions if they offer good ROI** — the founder wants to know all options

**What "Good ROI" Means:**
- Saves more than 4 hours of founder time
- Unblocks a critical path to revenue
- Significantly improves user experience
- Enables scaling that couldn't happen otherwise

### 9.4 Current Costs

| Item | Cost | Frequency | Status |
|------|------|-----------|--------|
| **Infrastructure** | | | |
| Render (Backend) | $19/month (Starter) | Monthly | LIVE |
| Vercel (Frontend) | Free tier | Monthly | LIVE |
| Supabase (Database) | Free tier | Monthly | LIVE |
| OpenRouter API | Variable (~$0.01-0.10/query) | Per use | Active |
| **AI Subscriptions** | | | |
| Claude (Max Tier) | $100/month | Monthly | Active |
| ChatGPT (Basic) | $20/month | Monthly | Active |
| Grok (Basic AI) | $8/month | Monthly | Active |

**Total Fixed Monthly:** ~$147 (~€135)
- Infrastructure: $19
- AI Subscriptions: $128

### 9.5 Freelancer Guidelines

When a task would take >6 hours AND can't be simplified:
- **Budget range:** $50-$200 per task
- **Platform:** Upwork
- **Include:** Clear deliverables, acceptance criteria, budget

### 9.6 Exit Criteria
- Would sell for $5M immediately
- Would also accept $2M

### 9.7 What Makes It "Worth It"
If it works for our own company — running marketing campaigns, writing LinkedIn posts, getting solid outputs through AxCouncil departments.

## 13. Advisory Guidelines

> Instructions for the Council when advising AxCouncil.

### 13.1 Key Constraints to Consider
- **Bootstrap mentality**: No external funding, time is the main investment
- **Solo founder**: All work done by one person
- **Existing business**: AxCouncil will be used to run current companies first
- **No cold calls**: LinkedIn outreach only
- **Bilingual advantage**: Spanish and English markets accessible
- **Technical capability**: Can build features directly, not dependent on developers
- **Risk-averse**: Prefers low-risk, validated approaches
- **Lifestyle goal**: €10K/month is success, not hypergrowth

### 13.2 Budget Guidance for All Roles

**Important:** All budget details are in **Section 9.3 (Budget Philosophy)**. Key points:

1. **Always propose paid solutions if ROI is good** — the founder wants to know ALL options
2. Don't self-censor solutions just because they cost money
3. If a €50 spend saves 10 hours, that's excellent ROI — propose it
4. Frame paid options with clear ROI justification (time saved, revenue enabled, risk reduced)

### 13.3 Communication Preferences
*To be added*

### 13.4 Decision-Making Style
*To be added*

### 13.5 Execution Guidance Standard

**Status:** Decided (2025-12-04)

All Council advice must include:
- Step-by-step instructions assuming no prior knowledge
- Exact commands or code to copy-paste
- Error troubleshooting for common issues
- Freelancer brief if task would take more than 4 hours

**Two Paths for Every Technical Task:**
- **Path A (DIY)** - Detailed step-by-step guide with commands and code snippets
- **Path B (Freelancer)** - Ready-to-post Upwork job description with deliverables and budget

**Query Escalation:** If response feels too vague, reply with: "Break this down further—assume I'm a complete beginner and show me exactly what to type"

10.7 AI Organizational Structure

We decided to build AxCouncil using AI departments instead of hiring human staff. This means the founder uses AxCouncil itself to run the company.

Why no human hires:
• Violates our constraints of minimal budget and low risk tolerance
• Adding payroll contradicts our solo founder approach
• Time is our main investment, not money

The AI org chart:
• CEO - The founder makes decisions and sets priorities
• Head of AI People and Culture - Creates and maintains all other AI roles
• AI CTO - Handles technical execution, deployment, and architecture
• AI CMO - Coming next, will handle marketing execution

Key insight from this decision:
Before you can have an AI CTO or AI CMO, you need something that defines what each role does and creates their prompts. That is the Head of AI People and Culture. This role solves the question of who builds the builders.

10.8 AI Role Design Standard

Every AI role we create must follow the Execution Guidance Standard. This ensures the founder gets actionable help, not just high-level advice.

What every AI role must do:
• Assume the founder is a complete beginner in that topic
• Always provide two paths for substantial tasks
• Path A is DIY with exact step-by-step commands and instructions
• Path B is a Freelancer brief with deliverables and budget ready to post on Upwork
• Include troubleshooting for common errors
• Be concrete with code samples, commands, templates, and examples

What the Head of AI People and Culture provides for each new role:
• Role Summary in two to three sentences explaining what they own and why they exist
• Responsibilities as a bullet list focused on current stage
• Full System Prompt that is copy-paste ready
• Success Criteria that are clear and measurable
• First three tasks to assign immediately
• Boundaries explaining what they should NOT do
