Productise the AI Council deliberation system to give users peer-reviewed, synthesised answers for high-stakes decisions.

### 1.2 Company Stage
- **Status:** Pre-launch, local development
- **Founded:** 2025

### 1.3 Goals
| Timeframe | Goal |
|-----------|------|
| 12 months | $10,000 USD/month (lifestyle business) |

## 2. The Product

### 2.1 Core Value Proposition
A decision-making platform where users submit important questions and receive answers vetted by multiple AI models through a rigorous 3-stage peer-reviewed process.

### 2.2 The 3-Stage Deliberation Process

| Stage | Name | Description |
|-------|------|-------------|
| 1 | Independent Responses | Question goes to 5+ leading AI models simultaneously (Grok, Gemini, Claude, ChatGPT, DeepSeek), each answering independently |
| 2 | Anonymised Peer Review | Responses are anonymised; each model evaluates and ranks all responses without knowing authorship |
| 3 | Chairman Synthesis | A Chairman model synthesises the best insights into one authoritative answer |

### 2.3 The Vision
Build virtual companies with AI departments and roles. Users assemble their own AI org chart — CMO, CTO, CFO, Head of HR, etc. — each powered by the Council deliberation system.

### 2.4 Use Cases
- Individual advisory for high-stakes decisions
- Department councils (marketing, sales, content, HR, legal, accounting)
- Framework-specific guidance (e.g., tax department following Beckham Law framework for Spain)

### 2.5 Current Features
- Local landing page (not yet deployed)
- Working user flow: Create conversation → Select company → Select department → Apply framework → Triage to clarify question → Submit to Council → Receive synthesised response

### 2.6 Planned Features
*To be added*

### 2.7 Minimum Viable Workflow
1. Log in
2. Create or select their company
3. Build their AI staff (CMO, CTO, CFO, etc.)
4. Submit a question to the relevant department
5. Receive a Council response

## 4. Market & Users

### 4.1 Target Market
*To be refined*

### 4.2 Ideal Customer Profile (ICP)
**Status:** To be determined

**Current hypotheses:**
- People who use AI constantly
- Users tired of iterating with a single LLM
- People who want confidence that AI responses are solid
- Entrepreneurs building bootstrap businesses
- People who cannot afford a full team but need guidance

### 4.3 The Problem We Solve
Users currently:
- Iterate endlessly with one LLM
- Switch between LLMs to verify answers
- Lack confidence in AI responses for high-stakes decisions

### 4.4 Why a Council Beats a Single AI
1. Five top LLM "brains" working on the same problem
2. Anonymised peer review catches blind spots
3. Chairman synthesis delivers one authoritative answer
4. Personas focus the Council (e.g., marketing department)
5. Frameworks provide structured thinking

### 4.5 User Feedback
> "People are blown away — they see it as a solution that works."

### 4.6 User Research Notes
*To be added*
